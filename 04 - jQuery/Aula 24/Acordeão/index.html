            <h3>Dark Knight</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The pious Ishgardian clergy guide the flock, and the devout knights protect the weak. Yet even the holiest of men succumb to the darkest of temptations.
                    <br><br> 
                    None dare to administer justice to these sacrosanct elite residing outside the reach of the law. Who, then, defends the feeble from the transgressions of those meant to guide and protect them?
                    <br><br>
                    A valiant few take up arms to defend the downtrodden, and not even the holy priests and knights can escape their judgment. Pariahs in their own land, they are known by many as “dark knights.”
                    These sentinels bear no shields declaring their allegiance. Instead, their greatswords act as beacons to guide the meek through darkness.

            <h3>Red Mage</h3>
            <div id="redMage">
                <p>
                    On the eastern edge of Abalathia's Spine lies the mountainous region of Gyr Abania.
                    <br><br>
                    It is in these elevated lands that people took shelter, when a burning star guided them away from the Sixth Umbral Calamity's treacherous floodwaters. The survivors gathered from near and far, and amongst them were refugees of the sorcerous cities of Mhach and Amdapor.
                    <br><br>
                    These sworn enemies buried their history for the sake of the future, and cast aside their vestments of black and white. Upon the remnants of their arts a new discipline was built, and the first red mages stepped forward with rapiers in hand to fight back against the rising tides of destruction.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Paladin</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    For centuries, the elite of the Sultansworn have served as personal bodyguards to the royal family of Ul'dah. Known as paladins, these men and women marry exquisite swordplay with stalwart shieldwork to create a style of combat uncompromising in its defense. Clad in brilliant silver armor, they charge fearlessly into battle, ever ready to lay down their lives for their liege.
                    <br><br>
                    To be a paladin is to protect, and those who choose to walk this path will become the iron foundation upon which the party's defense is built.
